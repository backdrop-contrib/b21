B21
===

B21 is a minimalistic pastel-colored theme with basic Color module support, 
inspired by the look and feel of the WordPress theme Twenty Twenty-One.

Installation
------------

- Install the theme using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/skin-with-themes.
- Visit the Appearence page under Administration > Appearence (admin/appearance)
  to activate the theme.

Configuration
-------------

- Navigate to Administration > Appearence > B21 settings 
(admin/appearance/b21/settings) to switch the Color scheme.

Good to know
------------

- On wider screens, B21 overwrites Backdrop's core layouts Moscone and Moscone 
  Flipped to display the sidebar one-third wide instead of only 25%.
- If you have many items in the Primary navigation dropdown menu, on medium wide 
  screens there may not be enough space to see all items.

Overriding CSS and sub-theming
------------------------------

To override the CSS styles of B21, or to build a sub-theme of the theme, 
please refer to the following resources.

- Sub-theme documentation:
  https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/creating-sub-themes
- CSS Injector module:
  https://backdropcms.org/project/css_injector
  CSS Injector allows you to add CSS to Backdrop based on configurable rules.
  The module is useful for adding simple CSS tweaks to your themes.
